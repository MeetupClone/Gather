# Gather

gathÂ·er
1. come together; assemble or accumulate.

Gather is a app created by Shiva Patel, Chuck Cipione, Peter Miles, and Mackenzie Clark. What started as a clone of meetup.com turned into a reconstruction of the idea of gathering, and we recreated it in our own image. 



## About the App 

The app was developed with React, Redux, Express, Node, PostgresSQL, and Firebase. While the project development is ongoing, the base product was completed in two weeks.
